Introduction:
This project was designed in an attempt to solve the issue of finding pictures of sheet music and needing to manually transcribe the contained music in order to arrange or transpose said music. While the scope of the project is limited and inaccurate, this is not for lack of effort. Despite hours put in training machine learning algorithms and studying computer vision web forums, this project proved a worthwhile challenge, and will continue to be worked on when the time arises. 

More detailed instructions on how to implement this project (in its current state) are available in the documentation.txt. 

Additionally, please note that the OpenCV directory here is not in any way owned by myself, but is instead a part of a larger, open-source project. The credit belongs to that project for the development of all of the OpenCV tools.
